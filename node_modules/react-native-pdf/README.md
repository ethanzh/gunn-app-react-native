A react native PDF view component (cross-platform support)

### Feature

* read a PDF from url/local file/asset and can cache it.
* display horizontally or vertically
* drag and zoom
* double tap for zoom
* support password protected pdf

### Installation
We use [`react-native-fetch-blob`](https://github.com/wkh237/react-native-fetch-blob#installation) to handle file system access in this package,
So you should install react-native-pdf and react-native-fetch-blob

```bash
npm install react-native-fetch-blob --save
npm install react-native-pdf --save

react-native link react-native-fetch-blob
react-native link react-native-pdf
```

### FAQ

Q1. After installation and running, I can not see the pdf file.  
A1: maybe you forgot to excute ```react-native link``` or it does not run correctly.
You can add it manually. For detail you can see the issue [`#24`](https://github.com/wonday/react-native-pdf/issues/24) and [`#2`](https://github.com/wonday/react-native-pdf/issues/2)

Q2. When running, it shows ```'Pdf' has no propType for native prop RCTPdf.acessibilityLabel of native type 'String'```  
A2. Your react-native version is too old, please upgrade it to 0.47.0+ see also [`#39`](https://github.com/wonday/react-native-pdf/issues/39)
